# CS-2006-Operating-Systems-Project-THREAD-VS-PROCESS

## Description
This project is mainly to show the difference between threads and processes in
terms of execution time.

## Prerequiste
- C language
- Data Structures.
- Basic understanding of process and threads.


## Installation
1. Provide the input file.
2. Compile the code using normal C language compiler on linux.
3. Run the compiled file.

## Objectives
1.  To understand the differences between processes and threads in terms of performance and memory usage.
2.   To implement different sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, selection, quick sort) using C language.
3.    To measure and compare the total time taken by CPU to sort an array using processes and threads.
4.    To analyze and present the results in a clear and understandable way

## Project Details

The project aims to compare the performance of processes and threads for sorting an array using different sorting algorithms in C language. The project will implement four sorting algorithms: bubble, insertion, selection, and quick sort. The project will use the OpenMP library to implement the multithreading. The project will measure the total time taken by the CPU to sort the array using processes and threads and compare the results.

The project will have the following steps:
1.	    Implement the four sorting algorithms using C language.
2.	    Implement the sorting algorithms using processes and threads.
3.	    Measure the total time taken by the CPU to sort the array using processes and threads.
4.	    Compare the results and analyze the performance of processes and threads for sorting algorithms.
5.	    Present the results in a clear and understandable way using graphs.

## Usage
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The input file contains the total number of elements present in the file, then from 
second line the elements of the array for sorting are to be provided.
2. Output shows the start time (before sorting) and ending time (after sorting).
3. The total time taken is also printed on console that is in seconds. 


## History
Threads were basically used to reduce the time taken by a program to execute. Threads 
are capable of reducing the execution time when we are using multicore processsors.
In case of small programs the threads take longer to execute as context switching time 
is much more effective. As every thread makes its own PCB and stack so its takes more 
time for execution.
